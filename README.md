# Sorting-Unknown-Skus-Database
Sorting Unknown Skus with a Database so it can run on Multiple Machine in sync for faster sorting. 
Uses a Microsoft Access Database to store information.
Rename source location in code to your db1.mdb file included in repository
I recommend using Dropbox (or on a shared network drive) for db1.mdb location so you can use on multiple machines for faster sorting
